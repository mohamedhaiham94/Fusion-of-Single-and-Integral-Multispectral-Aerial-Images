Source Code and Data: Fusion of Single and Integral Multispectral Aerial Images
====================================================================

This is a pytorch implementation of Youssef, M. and Bimber, O., 2023. Fusion of Single and Integral Multispectral Aerial Images. arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.17515. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17515)

**Abstract:**
We present a novel hybrid (model- and learning-based) architecture for fusing the most significant features from conventional aerial images and integral aerial images that result from synthetic aperture sensing for removing occlusion caused by dense vegetation. It combines the environmentâ€™s spatial references with features of unoccuded targets. Our method out-beats the state-of-the-art, does not require manually tuned parameters, can be extended to an arbitrary number and combinations of spectral channels, and is reconfigurable to address different use-cases.

# Installation
* Download and extract.
* Install Python (>3) and the required packages (common data science packages such as numpy, pandas, opencv2, ...). 
* Install PyTorch. 
* Run 'test.py' and the generated fused image will be saved to results folder, similar if you want to run alhpa-blending or colormap fusion.
